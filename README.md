### ‚å¨ Pixel Rogue - ( Programming 1 )

This is my first game that I have ever made and I used unity. I'll upload the source code probably of this game also so if anyone wants to improve the game and make it better, just tell me. 

It's a Rogue-Like game with pixel art graphics, you can jump, move, attack and block. There are 5 enemies in total a Guardian, Witch, Bat, Wolf & Golem.
